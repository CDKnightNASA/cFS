Backwards or cross compatibility is not supported between the cFE, OSAL, and PSP.
Application verification against this version are documented on the https://github.com/nasa/cFS/.
Lab Tools and Lab Applications are also dependent on the latest releases and not generally
backwards compatible.  The released bundle associates the versions that have been tested together.

There are no requirements changes or major behavioral changes in this release.

#### Marked for Deprecation (will be removed in future release) ####
Define OSAL_OMIT_DEPRECATED and CFE_OMIT_DEPRECATED_6_6 to check for compliance.
In general, replacements are detailed in associated API headers or are no longer needed by underlying software.

#### Unit Testing On Host (Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS) ####
At the cFS level, the following tests can be run on the host:
- OSAL tests (osal/src/tests)
  - count-sem-test, sem-speed-test, mutex-test, bin-sem-timeout-test, queue-timeout-test, bin-sem-flush-test, 
  osal-core-test, file-api-test, bine-sem-test, symbol-api-test, timer-test
- OSAL unit tests (osal/src/unit-tests)
  - osal_core_UT, osal_loader_UT, osal_filesys_UT, osal_file_UT, osal_network_UT, osal_timer_UT
- cFE unit tests (cfe/fsw/cfe-core/unit-tests)
  - es_UT, sb_UT, evs_UT, tbl_UT, time_UT, fs_UT

Procedure:
- Start with standard setup detailed on cFS README (set PERMISSIVE mode if needed)
- (Re)do prep, build, install, test, and report coverage with unit tests enabled
  ```
  make distclean
  make ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=TRUE SIMULATION=native prep
  make
  make install
  make test
  make lcov
  ```
- Note the osal_timer_UT test frequently fails on Linux, re-execute should eventually pass

Current cFE coverage rate (includes unit test code and stubs, and not a true coverage against baseline of all files):
- lines......: 92.6% (20233 of 21841 lines)
- functions..: 95.9% (827 of 862 functions)

See the attached console and results files attached to the release (ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS_*).

At the OSAL level, the following tests can be run on the host:
- OSAL coverage tests for the shared layer (osal/src/unit-test-coverage/shared):
  - shared-binsem, shared-clock, shared-common, shared-countsem, shared-dir, shared-errors, shared-file, 
  shared-filesys, shared-fpu, shared-heap, shared-idmap, shared-interrupts, shared-module, shared-mutex, 
  shared-network, shared-printf, shared-queue, shared-select, shared-sockets, shared-task, shared-timebase, 
  shared-time
- Note other OSALS coverage tests (posix-ng/vxworks6/vxworks-ng) were not executed on this release

Procedure:
  - From a fresh directory to build tests (used build_osal_cov in cFS below)
  ```
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug -DOSALCOVERAGE_TARGET_OSTYPE='shared' -DOSAL_INCLUDEDIR=../bsp/pc-linux/config/ ../osal/src/unit-test-coverage/
  make
  make test
  ```
TBD coverage report (really based on including the c code in ut wrappers, so not true coverage vs baseline).
VxWorks OSAL coverage TBD


#### Unit Testing On Target (MCP750, VxWorks 6.9) ####
Functional TBD

#### Build Verification Testing ####
The cFE 6.7.0 build verification was performed against the code tag 6.7.0-bv.  It was tested by Walt Moleski
in the cFS Lab using the mcp750 target with VxWorks 6.9.  Testing was completed on 10/8/2019.  Note header 
and document changes may occur after the 6.7.0-bv tag, and are included in the official release.  This verification
does not imply any fitness for use per the associated licencing.

There were 17 Build Verification tests executed and they all passed. Three (3) alternate image configuration
tests were NOT executed since they required a separate compilation of the cFE using different values for 
several configuration parameters as well as introducing changes to the BSP/PSP code. They were the Alternate 
Image test (cfe_AltImage), Object Creation Failure test (cfe_OSObjFailure), and the user-defined exception 
handler test (cfe_myeh).

There were several requirements that were not tested. They are:
- Device Driver requirements are not implemented.
  - cES1324; cES1325; cES1326; cES1326.1; cES1327, cES1508.3
- PSP/BSP and mission configuration dependent requirements:
  - cES1515.1; cES1702.2; cES1702.3; cES1703.2; cES1703.3
  - Note cES1702.2 and cES1703.3 were tested when PSP issue #77 was resolved with custom setup (not part of
  build verification)
- Time client configuration requirements that are not supported by the test hardware:
  - cTIME2012.1; cTIME2013; cTIME2014; cTIME2701; cTIME2702; cTIME2703

#### Other Targets ####
This code was also built for and executed on the following targets:
-	Ubuntu 18.04 x86 64 bit
-	Docker Alpine Linux x86 64 bit ( using OSAL_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE )
-	Raspberry Pi armv6 32 bit ( equivalent of Debian 9)
-	Raspberry Pi Docker armv6 32 bit Alpine Linux ( using OSAL_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE )
