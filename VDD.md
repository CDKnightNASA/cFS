Backwards or cross compatibility is not supported between the cFE, OSAL, and PSP.
Application verification against this version are documented on the https://github.com/nasa/cFS/.

There are no requirements changes, major behavioral changes, or major API changes in this release.

#### Summary of bug fixes and enhancements ####

- Refactor OSAL to reduce code duplication
- Deprecated classic build in favor of cmake
- Deconflicted performance IDs
- Fixed various typos in variables, comments, prints
- Removed CVS flags
- Replaced deprecated references

#### Document and Other Non-FSW Updates ####
- Removed non-ascii characters in text files
- Improvements to version control ignore lists
- Scripts set as executable

#### Unit Testing ####
Unit - steps, results, coverage TBD

VxWorks OSAL coverage TBD

Functional TBD

#### Build Verification Testing ####
The cFE 6.7.0 build was tested by Walt Moleski in the cFS Lab using the mcp750 target with VxWorks 6.9.
Testing was completed on 10/8/2019.

There were 17 Build Verification tests executed and they all passed. Three (3) alternate image configuration
tests were NOT executed since they required a separate compilation of the cFE using different values for 
several configuration parameters as well as introducing changes to the BSP/PSP code. They were the Alternate 
Image test (cfe_AltImage), Object Creation Failure test (cfe_OSObjFailure), and the user-defined exception 
handler test (cfe_myeh).

There were several requirements that were not tested. They are:
- Device Driver requirements are not implemented.
  - cES1324; cES1325; cES1326; cES1326.1; cES1327, cES1508.3
- PSP/BSP and mission configuration dependent requirements:
  - cES1515.1; cES1702.2; cES1702.3; cES1703.2; cES1703.3
- Time client configuration requirements that are not supported by the test hardware:
  - cTIME2012.1; cTIME2013; cTIME2014; cTIME2701; cTIME2702; cTIME2703

#### Other Targets ####
This code was also built for and executed on the following targets:
-	Ubuntu 18.04 x86 64 bit
-	Docker Alpine Linux x86 64 bit ( need to use the OSAL PERMISSIVE_DEBUG option )
-	Raspberry Pi armv6 32 bit ( equivalent of Debian 9)
-	Raspberry Pi Docker armv6 32 bit Alpine Linux ( again PERMISSIVE OSAL_DEBUG )
